For me, it holds relevance as a key element to navigate the rigors of a predominantly male influenced industry. I was always one to shy away from intimidating environments, so it was no surprise that when I decided to venture into the field of Commercial Real Estate, it was rather challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, keeping in mind that I was a college sophomore when I made this decision, I faced not one, but two major challenges. I was a female novice in the field, in the midst of a transition from being in the comfort of my peers 24/7, to finding the ideal balance between academic excellence and long work hours in a cutthroat environment. At that point in time, in a fragile place, I felt as if I was facing the pressure of one mistake tanking my credibility. The question was what do I do here? How do I adapt and create a worthy presence in an environment that I don’t necessarily fit the traditional bill for? Here’s my take on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first interview, I felt as if the broker was impressed by my confident demeanor and enthusiasm to excel, but with a slight shadow of doubt. I was asked that if as a woman, would I be able to stick to a career in which I would have to work long hours and prioritize my job over everything else, even ten years from now when I would potentially have familial responsibilities? I was completely thrown off guard to say the least, but my insatiable need to prove a point and the fact that I was passionate about Commercial Real Estate fueled my strong work ethic moving forward. I made strategic changes in order to create a place for myself in the male dominated culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, there were many times after that when imposter syndrome would creep up on me, and my confidence would be negatively affected. I’ve dealt with the uncomfortable stares, the comments, the questions, and the awkward flirtatiousness. I wish I could say all of those things didn’t bother me at all and I could bounce back completely unfazed, but that doesn’t always happen. Over time, I developed thick skin and learned to replace my nervous giggle with a firm and appropriate response. To remedy my feelings of isolation, I found it highly valuable to be around like-minded female mentors who had gone through similar experiences. I kept putting myself out there, asking for change, finding my niche, making mistakes and experiencing rejection. But there were also times when I let the discouragement and struggles keep me on my toes. Those were the days I was amazed by my own abilities, and that created an entirely new sense of appreciation for what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost three years later, I’ve come to the realization that there’s no exact science to thrive in a male dominated field. Ultimately, I’ve learned to take the leap, use your most advantageous traits in your favor to instigate change, and unapologetically share your perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sonya</name></author><summary type="html">Despite the fact that we are way past the Darwinian era, the phrase “Survival of the Fittest” has evolved into a metaphor of its own.

&lt;p&gt;“She is going to hell. She’s not a Christian.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peanut butter sandwich-no longer appetizing- dropped, my head snapped to the side, and my voice asked the only thing I could think to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think I was that different from anyone else. Sure, my brown skin never really faced the dangers of sunburns, and my black hair almost singed in the Texas heat. My identity found a haven in Hinduism instead of the ideology of Baptist Christianity, but I didn’t think these were reasons to be discriminated against. And yet, acknowledging me and dismissing my existence was a clique of blonde, blue-eyed normals; this powerful group of eight-year-olds was at the top of an unestablished hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t be mad at us. The Bible says so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time stopped in that moment. Shock stopped the flow of my words. My mind buzzed. All I could hear was incessant ringing. From their looks of horror, I realized that the girls didn’t mean for me to hear their ugly whispers. But I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people in whom I’d cautiously placed my trust and hopes gravitated towards the “familiar”, and grew ignorant to my pleas for acceptance. My unwavering, unadulterated, child-like mind couldn’t process what I’d just heard. Blinking back tears, I swallowed my anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tell you that everything was eventually resolved, that room at the table was made for me. But I can’t. As I reflect on this story among others, I’m pulled back to my Hindu roots. The practice of ​ahimsa​ and its lessons of doing no harm to all living beings and practicing a life of compassion and respect to others encaptured my thoughts. Standing on the crossroads of possible actions, I weighed the possible consequences. If my words would negatively impact or harm another, then maybe they should not be said at all. Rather, my words should open up a dialogue toward understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only has ​ahimsa​ kept me from actions that would bring disruption to the peace of my tormentors, but it has also brought peace to my inner self. Engaging in my initial response of shock and anger would produce only greater anxiety and feelings of unsettlement. The teachings of ahimsa contribute greatly to how I choose to express myself and react to obstacles that may hinder my progress towards my goals. This moral and spiritual code defines my attitude of respect towards all people and beings, regardless of their backgrounds or religious texts. I am a firm believer of “Vasudeva Kutumbakam” which in Sanskrit means, “All of Humanity is one Family”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this realization, strength surged through my mind, but this strength cost me my innocence. No longer would I live obliviously, but as an individual who has experienced ignorance and uses it as an opportunity to grow myself as a self-advocate and to help grow others towards greater cultural and religious understanding and knowledge. While I took a step away from naiveté, I took a step toward understanding. I embraced my identity, or what drove me apart from the social norms of small-town Texas. As much I may not want to acknowledge it, being bullied helped empower me to discover my unwavering strength. While I wouldn’t have chosen this particular method of learning the value of ​ahimsa​, it allowed me to heal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>avani</name></author><summary type="html">The busy laughter of energy-filled third-graders cushioned the small corner of the cafeteria where I was sitting with my friends. “She is going to hell.

Though “Tenet” — should it hit screens mid-August — may serve as a box-office barometer for studios hoping to release blockbusters during a global pandemic, Hollywood’s comeback must be measured not by the dollars it generates going forward, but by the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since George Floyd’s murder on May 25th 2020, many Hollywood studios have expressed their support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Disney studios, for instance, has released a statement in support of Black Lives Matter, donated money to their causes, and released some of their titles concerning Black experiences in America for free. All of these gestures are emblematic of the industry’s response as a whole, and though they’re necessary steps along the road to meaningful change in America’s movie industry, they fail to concretely dismantle the industry’s economic and representational inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proper statement from Disney, and many other studios, for this movement starts with acknowledging a history few people seem to be talking about: the wealth production companies basked in prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and deem necessary to tell less “traditional” stories, grew out of decades of systemic racism, and almost exclusively white-male storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franchise-building — making multiple, interconnected movies in the same cinematic universe — is one of Hollywood’s oldest, most profitable practices, yet the process emblematic of the larger problem. Zooming in on superhero franchise-making trends, David Sims of The Atlantic asked Anthony and Joel Russo to comment on the current franchise-building formula in Hollywood, where studios, “build up capital to spend it on ‘riskier’ stuff[.]”*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Russo gestures towards the sinister systemic machine implied by Sims’ question, answering, “You’d hope that decisions would be made irrespective of the financials, but ultimately it is called show business, and things are driven by dollars and cents,” before pivoting to the system’s positives: “What’s great about audiences today is that voices can be heard, and people can collectively ask for things from their storytellers and receive them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick glance at upcoming projects in The Marvel Cinematic Universe — Disney is Marvel Studio’s parent corporation — might prove Joe Russo’s point. Marvel’s next wave of titles will be amongst the most diversely cast films in the studio’s catalogue. “Black Panther II,” “Black Widow,” “The Eternals,” “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” and “Thor: Love and Thunder” will all feature some combination of non-white, women, and queer characters in prominent roles, and be released in the next two years.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, releasing movies featuring a queer character — Kevin Feige, Marvel’s chief creative officer, and Tessa Thompson have hinted that Valkyrie might “find her queen” in “Thor: Love and Thunder”* — or a Pakistani-American actor playing a titular role, or a Canadian-Chinese actor as a main character twelve years and twenty two movies into their franchise-building endeavors points to Marvel’s and Disney’s about content that isn’t centered on white-male- dominant stories. It’s great that audience demographics can influence studios decision-making, but — as Russo himself points out — the audience is not the bottom line. The bottom line is money — bankability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attitude isn’t really anything new for a Hollywood production studio; a simple numbers dive into the directors and principle characters of the preceding twenty-two Marvel movies offers a sobering reminder of just how “risky” major entertainment studios usually deem non-white-male stories and storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of January, 2020, seventeen people have directed a Marvel movie. Of those seventeen, only one is a woman — Anna Boden, who co-directed “Captain Marvel” with Ryan Fleck — and only two are people of color — Ryan Coogler, who directed the critical and commercial success “Black Panther,” and Taika Waitit, director of the beloved “Thor: Ragnarok.”* It is hard to know how much Coogler’s and Boden’s relationship to source material factored into their hiring. Ideally, Coogler and Boden were hired for their technical prowess and sensitivity to the details of their respective scripts and characters, but it is impossible to know for sure — a corner Marvel has painted themselves into given its small sample size of female and non-white directors and main characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone arguing that no American-made movie is untouched by a studio’s filmmaking history would be correct — the thorough extent and scope of racism is not up for debate. It’s pervasiveness in entertainment does not give Marvel and Disney a pass; rather, it is long past time for studios to start making movies and franchises from a place of inclusion and diversity — not work their way there over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the success of recent hits like “Get Out”, “Us”, “Coco”, and “Crazy Rich Asians.” All fell within the top twenty in domestic box-office year end total earnings for their respective release years,* made back on average 19 times their production budgets globally,* and have Rotten Tomatoes ratings over 90 percent.* Each movie features people of color in principal roles and credits a non-white director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, these fur movies garnered such critical and commercial success while remaining untethered to a preceding white-male dominated franchise, whose financial security made their success possible. Director Jordan Peele has stated his desire to build his own cinematic universe, to which “Get Out” and “Us” both belong while“Coco” and “Crazy Rich Asians” have earned sequels, proving that profitable franchises can grow from “riskier” content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Hollywood studios were critically reexamining their past, they would understand movies like “Get Out”, “Us”, “Coco”, and “Crazy Rich Asians” must be the way of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of these four movies should not diminish the important accomplishments of filmmakers like Coogler, Waitit, and Boden, who worked within Marvel’s ranks to produce films which invite new types of audiences to see themselves on America’s big screen. Just imagine what our entrainment landscape would look like if Coogler, Waitit, and Boden, had been allowed in on the ground floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while major production companies like Disney finally push towards diversifying their narrative output, we must be honest with ourselves: it took a global pandemic, hundreds of protests around centuries of racial injustice, and senseless police brutality caught on camera for Hollywood executives and studios to publicly commit to Black Lives Matter. As long as Hollywood fails to recognize the reverberations of its racist past, it will continue to deprive non- white storytellers of equality, justice, and opportunity — all for an arbitrary bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

Then suddenly, I came across this bleak, disturbing statue that was surrounded by c​hrysanthemums&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped for a moment and observed what I saw&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a proud bronze white man
with a stern look, idly sitting on his horse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It struck a chord, so I stood there like the thinking man statue and let my thoughts run their course, thinking…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monuments once meaningful, now meaning less, following the meaningless deaths
and pools of blood that paved the way
for statues to stand over slaves graves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tides and waves too wide and tall 
no durag could contain or hold 
for a long duration of time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black bodies shipped across seas for nickels 
and dimes and like the imprint left by tight durags on overnight 
It’s still on my mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It drags on while my thoughts are racing 
keeping up the pace with racist horse statues
I’m still facing…but I look up thinking…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is this how Masta looked?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shooked, I continued to stand there 
like a statue thinking…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monuments momentarily monumental
back then folks were mental and overly sentimental&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About their white wigs, white horses,
white hoods, in white churches,
with white Van’s, filled with damn Daniels, 
that would ride around black neighborhoods 
to terrorize our families and friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irony is that they would prey outside of churches 
hoping that God’s children won’t stay for good&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we pray inside our churches,
I hope he hears us from the pews, 
over the pews shot from men in hoods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prayers are what we’re dealing with 
when a roof is over our heads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat there, elbow on knee, thinking…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monuments not meaningful, they are meaning less 
Moreso wholeheartedly hatred hidden in houses 
whose homes hold history that was never told
I’m sure slave masters would never read his story 
if all the text was written in bold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So books are still on shelves,
slave documents are still in chest,
next to their new Jim Crow
as they are continuing to build more nest
and invest in private jails
racist, rapist politicians
in powerful positions
who will probably grab this world by the pussy 
because life’s a bitch right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just clench my fist tight
as sweat gathers between my hands
I stand there like the thinking man, thinking…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monuments not meaningful,
they’re meaningless, less than whole&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the majority becomes the minority
their priority is to break us down into fractions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe why cops are dividing families
as black lives are subtracting
when people are adding 911 to their dial
to file a complaint on any melaninated child&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how racist cowards cower 
call cops cause they kill us
after arriving in less than an hour 
leaving no blood on the caller hands 
after using Dove in the shower
I’m thinking some squares are scared of our roots 
when it has always been black to the power&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we multiply We trump
Any tower
Any obstacle
Any problem
Any statue within our view&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I stood there in the shadow 
casted by a racist statue
holding a handful of 
chrysanthemums​, thinking…&lt;/p&gt;

She was “vibing” to a beat of a song from her playlist. I said, “what old song is that.” She said, just listen to the words Shanaya.”  And, these were the powerful words that echoed throughout the car, “Wake up everybody no more sleepin’ in bed. No more backward thinkin’ time for thinkin’ ahead. The world has changed so very much from what it used to be there is so much hatred, war an’ poverty…The world won’t get no better if we just let it be. The world won’t get no better if we just let it be, we gotta change it yeah, just you and me.” (Song by Harold Melvin &amp;amp; the Blue Notes).  I laid my head back on the headrest, closed my eyes and let the rhythm of the words flow in my mind and stir my soul. I began to reflect on the direction of my life and the journey I wanted to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirit of activism had been stirring in the depths of my soul since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida in the year of 2018. It was stirring in my soul when I participated in a protest march for gun control-sparked by the student survivors who were not only able to call national attention to an issue that’s been rampant ever since Columbine and call out politicians, journalists, and even their parents who said it was not the time to talk about gun control, but were able to orchestrate one of the largest youth-led demonstrations in America’s history- on my high school campus. It was stirring in my soul when I encouraged my peers not to be afraid to use their voice to speak out and be heard.  It was stirring in my soul when I put pen to paper to write a book to inspire my generation. Because, we ARE more than Snapchat and selfies. It was stirring in my soul when I expressed to my mother my desire to work on voter suppression/oppression issues. It was stirring in my soul when I thought about the untimely, unjustified deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Oscar Grant, Eric Logan, E.J Bradford, the list is long and disheartening. It was stirring in my soul as I watched human beings being put in cages, treated worse than rabid dogs- babies snatched from the arms of their mothers. Activism stirs in my soul. It is the extra beat in my heart that pumps determination through my veins. I stand on the shoulders of my mother, I stand on the shoulders of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, I stand on the shoulders of Angela Davis, I stand on the shoulders of Maya Angelou, I stand on the shoulders of the great Harriet Tubman- with profound conviction, spoke the words, “Live free, or die!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activism takes courage. “The scared don’t try. The weak die along the way. Only the strong survive.”  History has shown us, that determined and persistent individuals and groups of people who engage and unapologetically fight for what they believe to be right, just, and fair, will eventually succeed.  I think Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes said it best, “The world won’t get no better if we just let it be.” We must do our part to contribute to the uphill progression of our democracy. The world is in our hands, and in order to continue to break down the walls of hate, pernicious bigotry, and oppression of people of color; we must stretch beyond the hashtags of social media, because as I stated in my book, “Generation Z The Sleeping Giant Awakens We Have The Power,” “We Are More Than Snapchat and Selfies.” Registering to vote as soon as you hit the legal age to do so, is something that is in your control. Voting is intrinsic to the betterment of our country and stands as our voice in democracy. Along with voting, participating in organizations with cause(s) that you believe in and are passionate about, can make a profound impact in your community, school, and/or society. I implore you to strive to be the best that you can be, be determined to make a difference, and be persistent in your actions. The time is now GenZ’s to wake up and make the most out of any given opportunity to make a difference in the world in which you a part of. We are Generation Z!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shanaya</name></author><summary type="html">I vividly recall riding in the car with my mother to an event in the early part of Summer 2019.

The dim glow of an iPhone is the only light in the room. A thumb swipes routinely swipes upward. After thirty seconds, the grid ends. “UNLOCK MORE GUYS.” Almost mechanically, the thumb taps the top of the screen and the process repeats. All the while, while the body operates free of cognition, there is a little voice screaming in my head: delete your fucking grindr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the many things to be said of 2020, I find one sentiment universally relatable: this year has asked a lot of us. In battling both a global pandemic and systemic racial injustice, all of us have had to exert some additional labor, be it emotional or physical. This means that many of us are also trying to check-out when we can. A good book, a netflix binge, or a long yoga session can be a great opportunity for some solo escapism, but we sometimes need a little community, too. For many queer men and trans/non-binary folks, Grindr has long served such a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grindr continues to urge users to stay home and stay safe, but in a remote world, it has done all it can to keep people connected. In addition to its being an online hub for gay networking, flirting, and dating, Grindr has added virtual events suich as drag shows and celebrity interviews. On its surface, it’s the perfect place for people to coalesce around a shared culture, feel safe, and maybe even share that quarantine booty pic. However, for many queer people of color (QPOC), Grindr all too often contributes to the alienatation from which we are trying to find shelter. The reason? Grindr dudes are really racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new phenomenon. Since its release in 2009, the app has ultimately been seen as a venue for men to advertise their sexual preferences in hopes of finding their Mr. Right Now. Almost immediately, these preferences were racialized or otherwise discriminatory. Depending on your location, sometimes more than half of user profiles will have a “wish list”, explicitly stating either an interest in or aversion to such categories as “fatties,” “femmes,” “Asians,” and “Blacks.” In fact, such preferencing and objectification is prevalent enough to have inspired the creation of a website to call out those who perpetuate it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.douchebagsofgrindr.com/&quot;&gt;‘Douchebags of Grindr’&lt;/a&gt; is a mural of profiles all displaying some sort of sexual discrimination (e.g. “Please be white”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, this fails to strike many people as problematic. One user, interviewed for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/sv/article/bnpavv/so-many-gay-dudes-are-depressingly-racist-on-dating-apps&quot;&gt;VICE article on sexual racism&lt;/a&gt;, perfectly sums up the plea to innocence of so many men on Grindr: “If someone actually cannot get turned on by someone from a minority group, that’s not really something they can change.” As if it were a factor as inconsequential as height or hair color, many people see racial preferencing as simply another component of someone’s “type.” However, height is not a line along which the systematic allocation of resources has been determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Denton Callendar, a social scientist &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-015-0487-3&quot;&gt;who studied the correlation between sexual racism and generalized racism&lt;/a&gt;, explains, “sexual racism is a form of racism because, quite simply, it is the use of racial stereotypes to include or exclude groups of people. The reality is that our desires—like all of our thoughts and behaviours—are as susceptible to broader social and political trends.” This means that your attraction, or lack thereof, to a particular race is not some innate preference, but a prejudiced learned over a lifetime of socialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also means that the harm done to Grindr users of color is just as visceral as that which we experience from other racist interactions. In fact, between the intimacy of the setting and the vulnerability around human sexuality, oftentimes it can be sexual racism that is the most damning to a person of color’s psyche. And this doesn’t just mean negative racialized comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive racial preferencing, referred to as racial fetishization, is just as much an arm of sexual racism. Terms like jungle or yellow fever are thinly veiled attempts to reduce individuals down to racialized aspects of their appearance so that they can fulfil some sort of sexual fantasy. By fixating on a sex partners skin color or associate stereotypes, QPOC are being othered in a sexual way. There’s a pretty thick line between attraction and fetishization, and comments like “BBC” and “Sub Asian Bottom” usually indicate which side of that line you’re on (hint: it’s the racist side).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always surprising to me how fiercely queer men will commit to their racial preferences. Usually these men are white, but sexual racism reverberates through many racial communities on the app. Either way, queer men are continuously unable or unwilling to acknowledge their racism or the harm that their racial preferences can cause to queers of color on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, for QPOC, Grindr and similar queer social networking apps have become somewhat of a double edge sword. In a remote world, these apps present some of the only avenues for community, connection, and companionship. On the other hand, consistently dealing with sexual racism can leave us feeling smaller and more alienated than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, acknowledging the problem is not enough. As the recent surge of organized resistance to racial inequality should make clear, change will only follow rigorous and collective accountability. In a recent twitter thread, Guardian and BBC News writer Alexander Leon offers a series of infographics about sexual racism, including what you can do to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/m4YHqH6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/89Rj5j6/donald-inline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;donald-inline&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it may be unrealistic to expect every Grindr user to change over night, so it’s about time Grindr and other social media companies treated sexual racism the same way that they do other forms of racism. To be fair, many of Grindr’s recent events and panels have been aimed at sparking dialogue about racial inequality. Yet that users are still permitted to publicly display their distaste for Black and brown sex partners should remind us that conversations can never replace accountability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>donald</name></author><summary type="html">It’s just past midnight.

It offered a glimmer of hope and redemption in my current state of anguish and depression. The object was a recently sharpened Japanese knife, and one clean slice could set me free. Just one cut could launch me into oblivion and rip off the tight armor of pain encased around my body. This enticing thought would tantalize me multiple times a day. Whenever I would be doing something, no matter how distracting, my taunting self-critic would make his way into my mind: “You have absolutely nothing to offer this world — all you are is a walking failure. How are you such a fucking pussy? Are you really going to cry all day? Just kill yourself already.” No matter how convincing this voice was, I always thought of my friends and family. My sister and mother would be plunged into a permanent world of pain and misery if I went through with this destructive mission. Why would I want to make them feel like I did then? I would not wish that despair upon my worst enemy. If it weren’t for them, I would not be alive today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a viewer’s vantage, I’ve led a charmed life. I am smart, healthy, attractive, wealthy, and fun to be around. People would continuously seek my company; beautiful women were frequently confessing their feelings to me. This is undoubtedly an incredibly privileged lifestyle. But it was all an act; one worth a fucking Oscar and a Golden Globe. Due to my high EQ, I had the dating game down to a perfect science. Distance was my sword and mysteriousness was my shield; I used those tools like a hungry soldier ready for war. I presented girls with the image of who I wanted to be, not who I truly was. Whenever I showed them the highly sensitive, insecure, needy boy with abandonment issues, they would run away and leave me devastated. Since revealing the real me always resulted in misery, why do it? Although taking on this persona got me plenty of romantic success, this performance left me feeling both empty and tremendously guilty. I could not be my true self around the girl I loved because I knew it would push her away. That sad reality warped through my mind whenever we spent time together; however, it was masqueraded by the charming, cheerful, and entertaining character I was presenting. This rule did not only apply to girls; I presented a fake version of myself to friends as well. I grew up as a chubby, hispanic kid in a posh, British school: this was a losing formula for making friends. This issue transferred to high school. Although I had a core group of brothers that I consider family to this day, every girl I wanted to make friends with or was romantically interested in pushed me away. Often, when I talked to them, I would freeze and stutter due to the bullying I had received growing up. By the time I got to college, I had realized that being myself got me nowhere, so I put on a shiny fucking mask in every social endeavor. I quickly climbed the social ranks and became the “it” guy on campus, but knowing I had to fake my way to get there killed me every night. I was in way too deep. When I got home most nights, I stared at myself in the mirror and dissected every little thing about my body and mind. Every time, I saw my ten-year-old self in London, laughing and kicking a ball around, delicate and pudgy with a smile that melted hearts. Tears rolled down my face as I longed to embrace him tightly and tell him that everything would be ok, but I couldn’t. All I wanted to be was a role model for him and show him that things would work out for the better. But that was the beginning of the end for him. Insecurities would blister his mind, abandonment would constantly break his heart, and bullying would carve out his soul. This only got worse over time. About a year ago, I would stand over a secret ledge in my school as I looked down and prayed I would trip and fall — every fucking day. This is when I finally realized that I needed serious help. Due to my well crafted facade, no one had a clue what was going on inside. All that pain was locked in a vault and the key was nowhere to be found. No matter how much pain someone is in, people can become masters of disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into my first session with my psychiatrist feeling utterly defeated. The years of toxic masculinity imprinted in my mind made me think I must be crazy and less of a man for seeking help. I stared into my doctor’s eyes blankly as she told me I had severe anxiety and depression, as well as ADHD. White noise played in my mind for the next few hours; I could not formulate a single thought. Later, I intently observed the ranting, homeless man running around Union Square, thinking that could be my future. Within three months, I was on seven medications: two antidepressants, two anxiety medications, two ADHD medications, and benzos on the side. I felt like a complete zombie. Although being numb has its benefits, I could not feel any form of excitement, love, or positivity. However much pain I used to feel, the wave of chills when I heard a good song or the warm buzz when kissing a crush made it all momentarily vanish. There was nothing like those moments; they would replay in my mind whenever I was feeling down. But now, even sex felt like a chore; I went through the motions without feeling a single thing in my body. Music became nothing but sound, offering no euphoria or escape. Friends would ask me to hang out, girls would ask me to get drinks, but I could not bring myself to join them. I felt invisible and worthless. Who would want to hang out with someone this lifeless? In comes alcohol and weed, which became lethal in combination with the medicine I was on. After a couple glasses of Japanese whiskey and some tightly rolled joints, my unconscious was released and the loving, cute, bubbly ten-year old Lucas came flying out, and I loved it. I had relentless energy and confidence; I felt like I was on top of the world. In those inebriated moments, life felt easy and I had no desire to end it. That would all come crashing down when I was violently fingering my throat at the end of most nights as the walls were caving in. That momentary bliss resulted in two days of pain, depression, and intense suicidal ideations as penance. The combination of benzos, alcohol, and marijuana made my brain feel like someone tossed it in a blender on the highest speed. I still feel the effects of this concoction to this day. Nevertheless, as soon as a friend called, I popped the bottle open and fired another blunt — a vicious cycle with no end in sight. Although I was hellbent on continuing this path of destruction, my mother thankfully intervened and encouraged me to find another psychiatrist who did not enable this sort of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doctor was my last chance. I was worried that if this did not work, that might be it for me. But luckily this time, I found the right match. After extensive discussions and research, he concluded that I have bipolar type II disorder, which my previous psychiatrist had failed to see. Although well-intentioned, her drug cocktail exacerbated my issues and chemically made my suicidal ideations come at a much higher frequency. After three weeks of the worst withdrawals I have ever been through and, at times, unbearably strong suicidal urges, I came out on the other side. I feel happy, grounded, focused, and like myself for the first time since I was a child. All it took was one good doctor, a caring mother, and a willingness to change. Furthermore, I am off all anxiety and ADHD meds, as well as weed and alcohol. All I take now is Lithium, a mood balancer for people with bipolar disorder. However, not taking the anxiety and ADHD meds requires a high level of discipline. I still have anxiety and struggle with maintaining focus, but for these issues, drugs are not the answer, at least not for me. The natural medicines I now take are supplements, intense daily workouts, an hour of meditation, and a strict diet curtailed to my needs. I also aim to be sober from drugs and alcohol for the rest of my life. This regiment is by no means facile, but I never want to go back to feeling like that zombie again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life does not have to be a constant cycle of suffering and anxiety. Each of us has the power to break free from our pain and start fresh. Trust me; I know this is no easy path. I spent years walking down that endless road of misery, continually asking myself when enough was enough. Although men have advantages in many ways, in America, men committed suicide 3.6 times more often than women in 2018 and white men accounted for about 70% of suicide deaths. It’s my sense that this is due to a deep-rooted culture of toxic masculinity. In an effort to stay strong and not seem too effeminate, men refuse to talk about this shit: “Don’t be a bitch.” They keep their demons locked in a cage and refuse to give them attention. However, the longer they stay neglected, the quicker they grow. This mental strategy leads men to choose death as a route to deal with their pain. They simply can not imagine another way out. Not even a year ago, that was me. I could have been part of those statistics. Seek help. Seek guidance. Seek love. If you are scared of seeming crazy and being discredited, I was in the same situation. I beg you; please take a chance on yourself. Yes, I am bipolar. Yes, you may think I am crazy. However, I do not give a shit. I can finally accept who I truly am, and I fucking love that guy.&lt;/p&gt;

The diaspora in New York City represents a microcosm of South Asia - its vibrancy, its colorful culture, but it rears the ugly head too often, whether it be divisions of religions, nationalism, or of course, a very carefully constructed misogyny. It doesn’t come from Islam, and yet religion is used as a defense from accountability. It doesn’t come from Hinduism, and yet tradition is used as a facade to get away with it. Stop using God as your security blanket to justify your suppression of women. It has stretched from our homelands that are desperately trying to reform to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to break this down into three sections: Guilty, Mia Khalifa, Simping to make it easier to comprehend. It’s like a pyramid, top to bottom - the hierarchy of brown boy misogyny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GUILTY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past week or so, brown girls in New York City have been coming forward in what can be called an intense second wave of the #MeToo Movement. And this time, it’s coming for the brown boys who thought that our culture’s taboos would keep them safe. It’s not just random brown men either. It’s friends, it’s classmates, it’s family, it’s Khan’s Tutorial. Accounts like Telling My Truth, which was the first to go viral, are anonymously sharing the victim’s stories and urging their followers to hold the brown boy accountable for his actions. And they’re listening: in the past two days alone, there are thousands of comments tagging the said perpetrator’s school and employment in an effort to call attention to the specific story. As of this writing, Telling My Truth has been deactivated but To Be A Survivor and anon.co17 are still actively posting stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in classic brown culture style, we have men and even women, deflecting the issue, but let’s be honest, did we expect anything else? Instead of cutting ties with known rapists, these people are insisting that somehow it is still the girl’s fault. She was drunk. She was showing skin. She was hanging out with a guy late at night. “It’s haram,” they say. But what about forcing yourself onto someone? Is that not haram too? Prophet Muhammad (SAW) swiftly punished a rapist when a woman came to him. He did not try to convince her otherwise, he did not blame her - so who are you to gaslight a survivor? There in no link between rape and sexual desire. Don’t tell us to dress better - become better men. When the stories started to gain traction, brown boys claimed that these girls were ruining the man’s reputation. Did you not stop to think that he ruined her in every way imaginable? And what reputation are you talking about? Instead of standing with the victim, you’re out here defending your boy and asking her what she was doing. Who cares what she was doing? We know what he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over and over again, we are seeing the brown boys named defending themselves by insisting that while they are definitely assholes, they are not rapists. They’re saying they had consent from someone who was DRUNK. How dare you. How do you expect someone who is intoxicated to give you the same answers as she would if she were sober? You were waiting for her to be drunk enough to have your way. Their excuses are: “She was wet too!” “I know she wanted it.” “She was feening for me.” “She’s a clout-chaser.” “She continued to be friends with me after I did it.” “How come she didn’t report it to the police?” “How do you not know when you were being raped?” Their pathetic excuses won’t work on us. Tell me, do you know that physical arousal isn’t consent? If she wanted it, why are you so scared? Was she really feening for you, or are you gaslighting the trauma you caused her? I hate to be the one to ask, but tell me, what clout could a rape survivor possibly get when our own president is a rapist? And since you’re so smart, you must know that thousands of rape kits go untested at police stations, right? You must know that police do nothing to protect women. And you, of course, know the lengths a brown family would go to convince their daughter not to report her abuser. It is not the job of brown girls to educate you on how survivors process rape differently, there is no ‘correct’ way to react after being assaulted. But since I’m on the topic anyway, let me tell you that 70% of rapists are committed by someone known to the victim and continuing a relationship with an abuser is a common way of repressing the memory. It does not, in any way or form, negate the fact that the rape happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the friends of these boys? They’re defending them. They’re writing love letters in their DMs as proof of character. News flash: just because he held the door open for you once in third grade doesn’t absolve of him of rape. Brown boys have collectively come together to force the victims to prove their rapes countless times. One girl even had to screenshot her rapist’s “apology” and refuted every single thing he said because he tampered with evidence and screenshots. Brown girls don’t owe it to anyone to prove a single thing. And yet, they’re being pressured to so they can relive their trauma under a harsh spotlight. These are brown boys that we might not know personally, but they run in our circles. We have heard these stories before. It could have been any of us, and it is imperative to stand up for all brown girls. Break the damn bro code, call out your boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our culture downplays sexual assault because we are trained to believe that men are in control, and even if we know that men are the problem, we place the blame onto women because brown girls should compromise, be careful, and protect themselves. The shortcomings of brown men are somehow still our fault and ours to fix: jab iski biwi aayegi, toh yeh sudhar jayega (When he gets married, his wife will fix him). We never teach brown boys to not rape, we don’t teach them the word no. We let them get away with so much and it culminates into an explosion like the one happening right now, and it’s because of brown boys and their sense of entitlement, their overly inflated egos, and the failure of our culture to raise our men right. Our culture already makes women so vulnerable from the very moment they are born. The very first thing we’re told to do is close our legs, sit like a lady, cover yourself. Brown girls are already guilty from the time we step into this world. This is the very same reason why it is so frustrating and difficult to even say anything against an abuser, predator, and rapist - we are told to keep quiet because it won’t get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the thing is, it doesn’t start with rape. Men view rape as aggressive, forced upon sex, but ignore the cat-calling, groping, and casual touches we deal with while we walk down Sutphin. I don’t know who needs to hear this but saying MashAllah won’t cancel out the fact that you tried to grab a girl’s ass. Every time I try to explain rape culture and its consequences, I am hit with the same answer: “I don’t care, it’s a joke.” These are the same boys that turn around and victimize themselves when they are finally called out for their extremely perverted behavior. Rape is not limited to extreme force - and brown boys are the quickest to victim-blame. Save for a select few, so many brown boys are now saying that there are two sides of the story and that we should all wait for evidence - were you not paying attention? How much more evidence do you need? If your first instinct when hearing about sexual assault is to automatically discredit the victim, or start to talk about how women “lie,” as if that false equivalency even makes sense, unlearn your own misogyny. Growing up in a close-minded household isn’t an excuse to not educate yourself. Brown boys never keep this same energy for the 98% of rape allegations that are true but will hound to death the 2% that are false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s just our culture that’s failed us for being inherently insensitive to gender-based violence  - it’s the men. They lack empathy, they lack remorse, and they want us to ‘stop the cap.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIA KHALIFA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown boys are more often than not desensitized to violence - baba beats ami, he slaps your sister across her face, but he doesn’t hit you because you’re a mard (man). You may get angry at him then, you may shout to tell him to stop, but the violence seeps in through your veins. It runs through your veins so viciously that you watch media that inflicts violence upon women and you don’t even notice - be it your video games, the Netflix shows you watch, and the unethical porn that you consume. Suddenly, all the sharam (shame) that you speak of dissipates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me make it a tiny bit more specific: let’s talk about Mia Khalifa. Let’s put a pin in the conversation about Islamophobia and her Christian Forces tattoo (yes, they’re the same armed forces who allied with the IDF and led the Sabra/Shatila Massacre). It was not her active decision to partake in hijabi porn, although it was disrespectful and sexualized Muslim women, and sure, let’s hold her accountable for calling the scenes satire, but let’s not pretend that’s where the sexualization of Muslim women by brown men started. She was coerced into her contract with Pornhub during a low point in her life years ago and was never compensated properly. Pornhub refuses to take down her videos.  But brown boys don’t know that. All you know is that she’s the ‘Muslim’ girl from porn and crack a joke about her every time you see a brown girl wear glasses. She lost her family, she doesn’t get a second chance at first impressions, and gets shamed every day all because brown boys have an extremely exploitative obsession with her. You call her a disgrace but you actively watch her videos (special shoutout for Muslim-majority countries for always ranking at the top for porn consumption) and then take pleasure in picking her apart in your little locker rooms. And it’s all because you have been taught (and you believe) a twisted culture that allows you to belittle any woman for any reason. Brown boys have the audacity to say that she chose to do porn, that it was her fault for ignoring how our traditions work, and then say it’s not a respectful job to have - why does it irk you when girls profit off their own sexualization? Learn the difference between coercion and consent, and secondly, our traditions are rooted in the patriarchy - brown girls are not bound to them. Sex work is valid work, you can acknowledge that while still knowing that porn is violence against women. Both exist at the same time because rape culture is so normalized in our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slut-shaming is especially prevalent in our communities; brown boys love calling brown girls hoes, feens, and sluts for existing. Everything we do is a threat to their izzat (honor). Brown boys will get off to naked women on their screens and then go tell their girlfriends and sisters what to wear. They police the women in their life because they know that all men are, indeed, trash. They know because they happen to be one of them. You tell your sister to wear her dupatta (scarf) because you are the same man who looked at a woman lustfully as she walked down the street. You tell your girlfriend to button up her shirt because you know how predatory the male gaze is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMPING&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest form of sexism - and I say simply lightly because it is incredibly harmful and helps in climbing the sexist mountain - is literally rhetoric. Our generation has a lot of good things going for us: We have TikTok, we take care of our mental health, we’re pretty woke. But for some reason, we’re the same generation that let go of cigarettes (only for nicotine in a USB instead) faster than we let go of slut-shaming. Brown boys don’t realize that slut-shaming doesn’t have to be heard, it’s not just cat-calling, you don’t even have to call a girl a whore to her face. You just have to laugh at the rape joke your boy just told. You just have to turn a blind eye to your friend cheating on his girlfriend. You just have to say that she belongs to the streets. Think of what that means. You think just because a brown girl shows some skin, just because she is sexually liberated, and just because you can’t stand the fact that you can’t have her that she should be thrown out? It’s not just a joke. It’s suggestive of another ideology at play. Brown boys will do the same things that they think is “hoe behavior” but will never apply this double standard to themselves. Because they know they are immune to any type of backlash. So if simping means respecting women, then so be it. Be a fucking simp. Stop being nice to girls you want to sleep with and then throw all moral decency out the door. You belong to the streets, not the girl that rejected you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t think we don’t notice the fact that some brown boys hide their own sexism behind a soft boy persona. You can brand yourself a leftist and be an ally, but that performativity doesn’t do anything when you’re only doing it to appeal to women. You’ve built your base on the free labor of your female friends who taught you all the right things. The subtle sexism that exudes from self-labeled soft brown boys is typical, it’s quiet but it’s seething. You support your girlfriend being a feminist, but you want her to hold your hand while she’s saying men are trash? That’s not how it works. You are not exempt. You’ve done the bare minimum for women, congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many brown boys like to speak over women because they think it’s a personality trait to be sexist (and they like that their friends cheer them on for it). Brown boys have made up their minds that women’s struggles don’t even exist, so how can we ask them to be educated? You can’t sit here and tell us what YOU think real feminism is, don’t you dare talk over us who are trying to push a change through this stubborn society. You say that ‘men need to do better’ but put in zero effort to make the women you know comfortable. You don’t get a cookie for thinking you’ve never been even moderately violent towards a woman. Because chances are, you have and your girlfriend ignored it because brown girls are told to compromise isli mard aisi hi hotay hai (that’s just how boys are). Say it with me: Being nice to your mom, girlfriend, and wife isn’t being a feminist. If you still hate the ones that you think stepped out of a line set by the patriarchy, you’re a misogynist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MY TED TALK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When brown boys are born, they suddenly become the center of that household, even with daughters - and yet Islam preaches the exact opposite. Brown boys are coddled, they are taught that they can do anything and they will still be defended, they are told that a woman is something to step on for their own purposes. In the city where it seems so easy to be educated and respectful despite growing up in such a household, brown boys aren’t and they refuse to be. They want their girlfriends and wives to exist solely for them, because that’s how their parent’s relationship worked. Brown boys are quick to deem this as an unnecessary gender war because nothing affects them. It’s because you don’t care because you think you’ll continue to get away with it. I’m here to tell you that you won’t.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>hiba</name></author><summary type="html">Brown boys our age engage in the most violent projections of the patriarchy. The diaspora in New York City represents a microcosm of South Asia - its vibrancy, its colorful culture, but it rears the ugly head too often, whether it be divisions of religions, nationalism, or of course, a very carefully constructed misogyny. It doesn’t come from Islam, and yet religion is used as a defense from accountability. It doesn’t come from Hinduism, and yet tradition is used as a facade to get away with it. Stop using God as your security blanket to justify your suppression of women. It has stretched from our homelands that are desperately trying to reform to no avail.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why Instagram Should Not Go ‘Back to Normal’</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Naja.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why Instagram Should Not Go 'Back to Normal'" /><published>2020-06-29T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-29T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Naja</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Naja.html">&lt;p&gt;I am an Instagram user, just as you are and much like you I’ve noticed that my life has entrenched itself into this app. With a press of the “profile” button, I could see the display of what I want my hundreds of followers to consider to be my legitimate development. I don’t regularly talk to hundreds of people. If anything, in a single day I probably talk to a handful of close friends, maybe a past acquaintance to catch up. Or maybe I check up on family or people I’ve worked with to see how they’re fairing in these insane times. Yet, I return to this app and communicate with a void of countless people, which I honestly couldn’t have a substantive conversation with if we, by chance, met on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This truth is reliant on our image culture that forces us to model… well models. Celebrities, snapchat influencers and child actors have shown us what is an acceptable public image, and I feel the pressures of social media have forced us to copy the behavior we’ve seen on magazine covers and movie trailers. No one is to blame for this (besides maybe our parents who let us watch countless hours of tv), and no one is innocent of it. Let’s face it, not many folks are reliant on print media and books for their main source of information about the world. Books are expensive, many people in this country can’t read English and getting news on social media is way more accessible than getting a newspaper subscription. Though countless books on public discourse have detailed the perils of receiving all media through our phones and TV screens, who is there, really, to say that this is a shameful reality, it is our major form of communication. The main way we interact with culture. With emojis and pictures that last ten seconds, we live and breath images that tell our friends and followers stuff we feel they should know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, the murders of countless Black people by police officers have been brought to light, along with many voices advocating for large-scale change in how (if at all) communities should be policed. Petitions are being shared, links to donations are being posted and great works and videos by Black people have been spread to bring awareness to the many perils that plague the United States designed to hurt Black, brown and indigenous people. Though, as a Black user, waking up to murder and violence on the app has been exhausting, it is refreshing to see so many great resources being shared by other Black people and our allies. It has also been refreshing to finally have some cohesion on the app, reminding me that our profiles and posts are coming from real, learning, people and not a series of disconnected frames of captured and manicured memories. 
In more recent times, I’ve noticed that some users (primarily white people) are returning their feed to how it was before Black Lives Matter was a global conversation. These posts are relatively sparse, and honestly funny to see how some are incapable of “reading the room” and getting the clear sense that vanity is on hiatus. This is not only testament to those people’s feelings (or, rather, their lack-there-of) around the movement, but also of Instagram’s faults as an app to be used for a universal movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not lost on anyone that people make money on Instagram. I remember a scene from the Netflix reality show “Too Hot to Handle”, a show based on the striking images of the cast, where one woman remarked on her disregard for the final cash prize because she makes so much money from her Instagram profile. Instagram is a platform where targeted advertisement brings in billions for the universally beloved Mark Zuckerberg, his friends and various businesses and campaigns that benefit from the clicks and views the platform provides. These commercials are given the same amount of space as, say, a selfie would occupy. The Washington Post account could post about an article on the current status of the crisis in Yemen or about the latest covid-19 death toll. This amount of space is also then available to you for your dog photos. All of this is in an attempt to consolidate as much information into a swipe on your phone, so you stay on the app and click on and watch the ads that get in the way. In doing so, tragedy, celebrity news and updates from our friends are given to us in one calculated gift: entertainment. So Mark Zuckerberg, his friends and a handful of kind-hearted campaigns and companies could get their fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a bleak assessment of this app. I’ve also described the app as having an agenda, and I want to make it clear that all media does. The New York Times, for all its prestige in the public eye, has an incentive to publish material that wouldn’t, in any way, dissuade readers from discontinuing their subscription. This is true for all subscription-based media and its effects are often hard to notice at a glance. Instagram, in many ways, is a subscription service. We pay them by watching ads, allowing them to use our data to make better ads and complying with their user agreements so their reputation is not tarnished by individual actors. I’m making it clear that I feel like what I’ve described is wrong in the first place (and I feel like you should, too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I still used the app. Even when I read a post on a headline about the children in prison camps on the southern border next to a selfie from someone I don’t know next to a celebrity posting their dog next to another tragedy next to an ad next to another selfie next to a meme next to another tragedy; this goes on and on until I get bored and leave the app, to return 30 minutes later when I get bored again. This is turning tragedy into a commodity. The app gives you a package filled with horrible news, entertainment and advertisement to guarantee you keep swiping. This is an enormous time suck and has affected the way we perceive the news and the institutions around us, leaving much of the damage already done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in a time where vanity should surely be a second thought for many of you (again, namely white people), I beg that you recognize the gravity of this moment and stop posting selfies. Not only does it show those around you that you do not care, allowing them to feel lighthearted about the situation as well; it creates an app where Black tragedy is being accompanied by blatant and damning negligence. This renders the important places to donate, petitions to sign and other learning mechanisms a form of bleak entertainment, or “tragedy porn”, to contrast with the bright and baggage-less posts from privileged users. I just cannot stand idly by and let this happen. So many people have been unlawfully killed by a country that already pays them little mind. Too many of these stories have already occurred and too much nightmarish history has happened for people to allow the advocacy of Black people and our allies to be tragedy porn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram is a very difficult place to conduct a global conversation about Blackness and Black lives, but it is possible that it becomes a place where the advocacy for disenfranchised and targeted groups becomes its first concern over vain demonstrations of oneself. I hope anyone who reads this knows I am not explicitly talking about anyone in particular, but rather a general want for things to go back to normal. I also hope that those reading this do not think I am stepping up onto a moral high-horse and preaching the truth for mindless users to listen and comply. I am also guilty of allowing tragedy to accompany my substance-less posts. I want to stress that in participating in this app, I feel that we all are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s face it, this pandemic, its economic and political implications and the lives affected and lost from it are going to change how this country functions for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, as activists continue to flood the streets and demand justice for the countless Black names lost by the police, the way we talk about race and see ourselves in our communities will be different for the foreseeable future. Let’s take a hard step together and shed our profile’s aesthetics and tell our followers that we will put our own personal image second to the greater movement. Instagram can be a healthy place where we achieve a fruitful balance, but we have to recognize the space we are filling up and ask ourselves if this is contributing to the betterment of those of us who are underprivileged and have already had that decision made for us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>naja</name></author><summary type="html">I am an Instagram user, just as you are and much like you I’ve noticed that my life has entrenched itself into this app. With a press of the “profile” button, I could see the display of what I want my hundreds of followers to consider to be my legitimate development.

STAT" /><published>2020-06-23T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Anjali</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Anjali.html">&lt;p&gt;F**k you, 2020- the year my freshman year of college was cut short; the year I was moved away from my best friends; the year my family drove me crazy by being the only humans I saw for months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, f**k you 2020- the year developing countries struggled to deal with pandemics, epidemics, and famines; the year the unemployment rates hit all-time-highs; the year the police continued to harm innocent lives, because of the color of their skin.
With the cruelty and calamity that our phones and televisions constantly remind us of, it wouldn’t be surprising if some are questioning the entire essence of humanity. As healthcare workers continue to put their own lives on the line to save those of others; across the street, cops who swore to safeguard citizens continue to take their lives away. The dichotomy of ‘being human’ that has revealed its true colors in recent months is an inexplicable complex that can easily send you down a dwindling, downward spiral. However, the pressing nature of current events leaves no time to ponder. It’s time to shift our roles from informed bystanders to informed activists, with no time to waste.
To this end, here’s my scientific advice- go. eat. some. chocolate. Don’t get me wrong, this is NOT even remotely close to a quick fix- but it’s an essential first step that you, as a “newly born” informed activist, need to take. Let me explain.
As members of the human race, one thing we all have is a brain (even if it may not seem so these days). Our brains can be compared to the water bodies on this planet, in that we only understand about 10% of them. Surprisingly, even this 10% of understanding can give us a lot of insight into how we need to treat this ridiculously powerful organ in order to yield the best outcomes for ourselves and for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple, non-scientific terms, our brains are made up of a series of messengers, docks, and paths. The messengers, expectedly, are responsible for carrying messages and loading them onto or unloading them from the docks to travel down the paths. They can disguise themselves as several substances, one type being ‘endorphins’- groups of hormones that act on opiate receptors (i.e. their “allocated” docks). Through a series of scientific events, that are a bunch of blah blah unless you’re a fellow brain-fanatic (no shame), the receptors result in a feeling synonymous to that of euphoria. Chocolate, coincidentally, is a friend of endorphins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So essentially, through the simple act of biting into a chocolate bar: endorphins are triggered, and your brain undergoes some chaotic science to make you happier. If you’re a trooper, go for a run to get your dose of endorphins; but from personal experience, chocolate stands as the top contender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s join the dots. If you can remember from the days of pre-covid19 travel, the passenger announcements in airplanes would sound, “please secure your own [oxygen] mask before assisting others”. In the same light, we are living in a time when the world needs us, and we cannot afford to be in subpar shape. If we are allowing ourselves to mentally succumb to the tragedy that is an unfortunate actuality today or exposing ourselves to exhaustion- mental or physical- we will not be in a position to bring about the most effective change. While the plasticity of our brains allows them to create sentiments of optimism, they are equally capable of causing persistent pessimism. Unfortunately, our current climate has made the latter much too possible. To fully commit ourselves to fighting the bad (virus or police), we need to commit to fighting our brain’s bad tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just eat the damn chocolate, make sure you are a ‘well-oiled’ machine, and channel all your energy into helping those who need it now more than ever before.
From an amateur perspective, the only opinion towards 2020 is, simply stated, f**k you.
However, hopefully, we will look back on this year as a time when every able individual worked on their personal growth solely for the purpose of the imminently needed, joint growth. Afterall, “hindsight is 20/20”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>anjali</name></author><summary type="html">F**k you, 2020- the year my freshman year of college was cut short; the year I was moved away from my best friends; the year my family drove me crazy by being the only humans I saw for months.</summary></entry></feed>
