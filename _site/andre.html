        <p>So one day, I was at this park in the South walking around awaiting my friend’s arrival. Then suddenly, I came across this bleak, disturbing statue that was surrounded by c​hrysanthemums</p>

<p>I stopped for a moment and observed what I saw</p>

<p>It was a proud bronze white man
with a stern look, idly sitting on his horse</p>

<p>It struck a chord, so I stood there like the thinking man statue and let my thoughts run their course, thinking…</p>

<p>Monuments once meaningful, now meaning less, following the meaningless deaths
and pools of blood that paved the way
for statues to stand over slaves graves</p>

<p>Tides and waves too wide and tall 
no durag could contain or hold 
for a long duration of time</p>

<p>Black bodies shipped across seas for nickels 
and dimes and like the imprint left by tight durags on overnight 
It’s still on my mind</p>

<p>It drags on while my thoughts are racing 
keeping up the pace with racist horse statues
I’m still facing…but I look up thinking…</p>

<p>“Is this how Masta looked?”</p>

<p>Shooked, I continued to stand there 
like a statue thinking…</p>

<p>Monuments momentarily monumental
back then folks were mental and overly sentimental</p>

<p>About their white wigs, white horses,
white hoods, in white churches,
with white Van’s, filled with damn Daniels, 
that would ride around black neighborhoods 
to terrorize our families and friends</p>

<p>Irony is that they would prey outside of churches 
hoping that God’s children won’t stay for good</p>

<p>When we pray inside our churches,
I hope he hears us from the pews, 
over the pews shot from men in hoods</p>

<p>Prayers are what we’re dealing with 
when a roof is over our heads</p>

<p>I sat there, elbow on knee, thinking…</p>

<p>Monuments not meaningful, they are meaning less 
Moreso wholeheartedly hatred hidden in houses 
whose homes hold history that was never told
I’m sure slave masters would never read his story 
if all the text was written in bold</p>

<p>So books are still on shelves,
slave documents are still in chest,
next to their new Jim Crow
as they are continuing to build more nest
and invest in private jails
racist, rapist politicians
in powerful positions
who will probably grab this world by the pussy 
because life’s a bitch right?</p>

<p>I just clench my fist tight
as sweat gathers between my hands
I stand there like the thinking man, thinking…</p>

<p>Monuments not meaningful,
they’re meaningless, less than whole</p>

<p>Once the majority becomes the minority
their priority is to break us down into fractions</p>

<p>Maybe why cops are dividing families
as black lives are subtracting
when people are adding 911 to their dial
to file a complaint on any melaninated child</p>

<p>This is how racist cowards cower 
call cops cause they kill us
after arriving in less than an hour 
leaving no blood on the caller hands 
after using Dove in the shower
I’m thinking some squares are scared of our roots 
when it has always been black to the power</p>

<p>When we multiply We trump
Any tower
Any obstacle
Any problem
Any statue within our view</p>

<p>Still, I stood there in the shadow 
casted by a racist statue
holding a handful of 
chrysanthemums​, thinking…</p>

<p>“This is why we strive”</p>
