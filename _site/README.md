About
Who We Are:
Generations are loosely defined, not just in terms of biology but also in terms of history and technology. The Gen Z cohort refers to those born between 1995-2010 (plus/minus a few years), and we preach tolerance, inclusivity, equality, justice, and happiness. 

What we Do:
This is the first ever central hub for Gen Z writers/bloggers, videographers, photographers, graphic designers, entrepreneurs, activists, artists, etc. We accept submission from a diverse range of Gen Z’ers with unique stories, experiences, or messages. These submissions can range from articles to photos, from videos to spoken word, from poetry to political cartoons, etc. Share your personal narrative and connect it to broader themes and current events. 

What we Dream:
At this moment, sharing our lives and experiences across the globe will produce ideas and insights that generate ingenious solutions to the problems we face. The influence of Gen Z lies in its ability to take advantage of technology, hyperconnectivity, and instant access to information, which will create a far deeper understanding of humanity than what could have been possible in any generation before. A global, deeper appreciation for humanity is the first step to achieving the lofty goals of Gen Z:  social justice, economic equality, tolerance and peace.
